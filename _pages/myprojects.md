The following are some of the major project(s) I am/was involved in.

1. [Pathway in Forensic Computing (FORC)](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/projects/search/details/574063-EPP-1-2016-1-IT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) \[2017--2020\]:
   - FORC, an Erasmus+ funded educational capacity-building project, revolutionized undergrad forensic computing. Embedding pathways within IT and Law degrees, it fosters a multidisciplinary approach, bridging the computing-law gap and equipping graduates. FORC invests in faculty and curriculum for long-term impact, collaborating with labs to enhance regional skills. This propels the region towards modern, evidence-based forensic computing practices.
   - FORC, an Erasmus+ funded educational capacity-building project, brought together six educational institutions: [Middlesex University London](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/), [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/), [**Palestine Technical University - Kadoorie**](http://www.ptuk.edu.ps/index.php?en=en), [Al-Quds University](http://www.alquds.edu/en), [The University of Jordan](https://www.ju.edu.jo/), and [Princess Sumaya University for Technology](http://www.psut.edu.jo/). Additionally, it partnered with [Al Andalus Software Development](http://www.asd.ps/en_US/my-page/) from the industry sector.
   - I contributed to the book [Digital Investigation Techniques and Tools](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/project-result-content/e93349e8-5263-4422-9d03-603244210068/FORC_Book_5.pdf) by writing the **Digital Forensics Evidence Acquisition** chapter. Additionally, I participated in technical workshops across Palestine and Jordan, fostering knowledge-sharing and collaboration with regional experts.
