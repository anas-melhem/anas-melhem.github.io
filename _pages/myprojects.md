The following are some of the major project(s) I am/was involved in.

1. [Pathway in Forensic Computing (FORC)](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/projects/search/details/574063-EPP-1-2016-1-IT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) \[2017--2020\]: 
   - FORC is an educational capacity-building initiative that revolutionized undergraduate education in forensic computing.  This project achieved this by embedding specialized pathways within existing IT and Law degrees.  These pathways foster a student-centered, multidisciplinary learning experience that bridges the gap between computing and law. Graduates of these programs gain a comprehensive understanding of forensic practices, preparing them for successful careers. Recognizing the need for long-term impact, FORC invests in faculty development and creates sustainable pathways within the curriculum. The project's reach extends beyond academia through collaborations with established forensics labs, further enhancing the skillsets of professionals in the region. Ultimately, by modernizing education and cultivating a skilled workforce, FORC aims to propel the region towards robust, evidence-based practices in forensic computing.
   - The project was an Erasmus+ funded initiative, partnering with six institutes: .
   - I contributed to the book Digital Investigation Techniques and Tools by writing the Digital Forensics Evidence Acquisition chapter. Additionally, I participated in technical workshops across Palestine and Jordan, fostering knowledge-sharing and collaboration with regional experts.
