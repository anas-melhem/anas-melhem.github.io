I am currently work as Assistant Professor in the Computer System Engineering department at Palestine Technical University, with a PhD in Computer Engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University, North Cyprus. My academic journey also includes a master's degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Al-Quds University, where I developed a secure protocol for wireless mesh networks, and a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Palestine Technical College.

My exprties lies in the mathematical aspectes of cybersecurity, specifically cryptography. My work centers on posat-quantum cryptography (particularly from lattices), privacy preserving technologies, such as homomorphism, and updatable encryptions. I apply these methods to develop critical security features like confidentiality, integrity, privacy, anonymity, and accountability in real-world applications. 

Additionally, I have extensive experience in the analysis and cryptanalysis of various symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems. My research aims to enhance the robustness of these systems against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring their reliability and security in real-world applications.

I am also actively seeking opportunities for research collaboration. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:a.melhem@ptuk.edu.ps) to discuss potential partnerships.
