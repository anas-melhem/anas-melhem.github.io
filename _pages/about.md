An Assistant Professor in the Computer System Engineering department at Palestine Technical University. He earned his PhD in Computer Engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University, North Cyprus, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Chefranov](https://staff.emu.edu.tr/alexanderchefranov/en/personal-info/curriculum-vitae). During his PhD, [RCPKC](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/16/4632) was developed, a public key cryptosystem that is an integer-based NTRU variant immune to lattice-based attacks. Before his PhD, he completed a master's degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from [Al-Quds University](https://www.alquds.edu/en/), and a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Palestine Technical College.
 
His main research interests are in the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms and cybersecurity protocols, their applications, and the formulation and proof of their security properties. His work includes lattice-based cryptography and cryptographic primitives with extra functionality, such as homomorphic encryption. Additionally, he have conducted extensive analysis and cryptanalysis of various symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, including developing [a ciphertext-only attack on RSA using lattice basis reduction](https://iajit.org/PDF/Vol%2018,%20No.%202/19701.pdf). His research aims to enhance the robustness of these systems against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring their reliability and security in real-world applications.
