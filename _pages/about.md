An Assistant Professor in the Computer System Engineering department at Palestine Technical University. He earned his PhD in Computer Engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University, North Cyprus, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Chefranov](https://staff.emu.edu.tr/alexanderchefranov/en/personal-info/curriculum-vitae).

A major accomplishment of his doctoral research was the development of [RCPKC](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/16/4632), an advanced public key cryptosystem that is **an integer-based NTRU variant resilient to lattice-based attacks**. This innovative system was created through close collaboration with fellow researchers.

His main research interests are in designing and analyzing cryptographic algorithms, their applications, and the formulation and proof of their security properties. His work includes lattice-based cryptography and cryptographic primitives with extra functionality, such as homomorphic encryption.

Additionally, he has conducted extensive analysis and cryptanalysis of various symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, including developing [a ciphertext-only attack on RSA using lattice basis reduction](https://iajit.org/PDF/Vol%2018,%20No.%202/19701.pdf). His research aims to enhance the robustness of these systems against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring their reliability and security in real-world applications.
