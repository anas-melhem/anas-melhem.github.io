          contents:
            - Designed and implemented <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/16/4632" target="_blank">RCPKC</a>, a novel public key cryptosystem offering a remarkable 27x efficiency improvement and superior security over NTRU. This achievement stems from RCPKC's inherent resistance to lattice-based attacks, a critical vulnerability in NTRU.
            - Analyzed the security of NTRU and identified a critical vulnerability, leading to the design of the <a href="https://infonomics-society.org/wp-content/uploads/ijisr/published-papers/volume-6-2016/NTRU-Modulo-p-Flaw.pdf" target="_blank">NTRU mod p</a> attack. This attack exploits this weakness, allowing for the potential decryption of messages without the private key.
            - Analyzed the security of RSA and designed a novel <a href="https://doi.org/10.34028/iajit/18/2/13" target="_blank">ciphertext-only attack</a>. The attack finds the RSA encrypted message as the shortest vector in a 2-dimensional lattice. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the attack, successfully decrypting thousands of messages with key sizes up to 8193 bits.

      year: 2017-2020
      description: 
      - The FORC project aims to develop integrated forensic computing curricula for undergraduate IT and Law degrees using a student-centered adaptive learning approach based on the Bologna Process. This initiative will harmonize new courses across four universities in Palestine and Jordan, addressing multidisciplinary needs. By emphasizing forensic computing in education and professional practice, the project promotes evidence-based practices, establishes forensic labs, and enhances faculty capacity, ensuring sustainable and lasting impact.
