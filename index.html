He earned his PhD in Computer Engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University, North Cyprus, under the supervision of <a href="https://staff.emu.edu.tr/alexanderchefranov/en/personal-info/curriculum-vitae" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Alexander Chefranov</a>.</p> <p>A major accomplishment of his doctoral research was the development of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/16/4632" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RCPKC</a>, an advanced public key cryptosystem that is <strong>an integer-based NTRU variant resilient to lattice-based attacks</strong>. This innovative system was created through close collaboration with fellow researchers.</p> <p>His main research interests are in designing and analyzing cryptographic algorithms, their applications, and the formulation and proof of their security properties. His work includes lattice-based cryptography and cryptographic primitives with extra functionality, such as homomorphic encryption.</p> <p>Additionally, he has conducted extensive analysis and cryptanalysis of various symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, including developing <a href="https://iajit.org/PDF/Vol%2018,%20No.%202/19701.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a ciphertext-only attack on RSA using lattice basis reduction</a>. His research aims to enhance the robustness of these systems against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring their reliability and security in real-world applications.</p> </body></html>
