ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the core of the Internet of Things and require cryptographic protection. Cryptographic methods for WSN should be fast and consume low power as these networks rely on battery-powered devices and microcontrollers. NTRU, the fastest and secure public key cryptosystem, uses high degree, $N$, polynomials and is susceptible to the lattice basis reduction attack (LBRA). Congruential public key cryptosystem (CPKC), proposed by the NTRU authors, works on integers modulo q and is easily attackable by LBRA since it uses small numbers for the sake of the correct decryption. Herein, RCPKC, a random congruential public key cryptosystem working on degree $N=0$ polynomials modulo $q$, is proposed, such that the norm of a two-dimensional vector formed by its private key is greater than $q$. RCPKC works as NTRU, and it is a secure version of insecure CPKC. RCPKC specifies a range from which the random numbers shall be selected, and it provides correct decryption for valid users and incorrect decryption for an attacker using LBRA by Gaussian lattice reduction. RCPKC asymmetric encryption padding (RAEP), similar to its NTRU analog, NAEP, is IND-CCA2 secure. Due to the use of big numbers instead of high degree polynomials, RCPKC is about 27 times faster in encryption and decryption than NTRU. Furthermore, RCPKC is more than three times faster than the most effective known NTRU variant, BQTRU. Compared to NTRU, RCPKC reduces energy consumption at least thirty times, which allows increasing the life-time of unattended WSNs more than thirty times.},

ABSTRACT = {NTRU encryption is a standardized public-key cryptosystem which is considered faster than RSA and ECC. For encryption, NTRU adds the product of $ph*r$ to the plaintext, where $p$ is a predefined 
public parameter, $h$ is the public key, and $r$ is a pseudo-randomly generated blinding polynomial. For decryption, NTRU uses two private keys. We prove that for some parameters NTRU has the modulo $p$ flaw, so NTRU-encrypted plaintext can be disclosed just by applying modulo p operation to 
the ciphertext without the need of using any of NTRU secret keys. We provide also statistical estimates of the probability of having NTRU modulo $p$ flaw cases for different values of $N$, where $N$ is the order of polynomial ring used in NTRU. The probabilities show that NTRU modulo $p$ flaw may take place rather often. NTRU amendment to withstand the flaw is proposed. },
